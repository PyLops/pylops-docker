# PyLops Docker for batch jobs
Docker container for running PyLops applications as short-lived jobs in containers.

**NOTE**: to be able to run the ``poststack.py`` example with Volve data, you need to first add your *$TOKEN* from
the Volve village to the ``config.yml`` file. Instructions on how to retrive the token can be
found at https://github.com/equinor/segyio-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/pylops/01_seismic_inversion.ipynb.
