# PyLops Docker for batch jobs
Docker containers for running PyLops applications as short lived jobs.

**NOTE**: to be able to run the same example with Volve data, add your *$TOKEN* from
the Volve village to the config.yml file. Instructions on how to retrive the token can be
found at https://github.com/equinor/segyio-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/pylops/01_seismic_inversion.ipynb.
